# Example 6

In Example 6 we've changed our code slightly in order to add a custom log which
we can access the logs of our server. Note that we have to use the alpine
image in order to pass arguments to our command and create the default file.

## Running the Example

Run the environment

```sh
docker-compose up
```

And access the server on [localhost:80](http://localhost:80)
